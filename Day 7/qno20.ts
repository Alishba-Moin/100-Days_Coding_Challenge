// **Question 20:** Think of something you could store in an array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.

let countries: string[] = ["china","japan","england","thailand","australia","italy"]
for (let i = 0; i < countries.length; i++) {
console.log(countries[i]);
}
