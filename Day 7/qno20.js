// **Question 20:** Think of something you could store in an array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.
var countries = ["china", "japan", "england", "thailand", "australia", "italy"];
for (var i = 0; i < countries.length; i++) {
    console.log(countries[i]);
}
