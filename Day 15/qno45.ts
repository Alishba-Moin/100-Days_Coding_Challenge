// Q45 - Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.

function Cars(manufacturer:string, model:string,...extras:[string[],any]) {
    let car: object = {
        manufacturer : manufacturer,
        model : model
    }
    extras.forEach(([key,value])=> car[key]=[value]);
    return car
    }
    let myCar = Cars( "Ferrari","Daytona SP3",["Color","Blue"],["Year",2024]);
    let myCarr = Cars("Ford", "Fiesta", ["color", "blue"], ["sunroof", true]);
