// Question 14: Guest List: If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people youâ€™d like to invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.
var guests = ["Ahsan", "Daniyal", "Alishba", "Zimal"];
for (var i = 0; i < guests.length; i++) {
    console.log("Dear ".concat(guests[i], ", i invited you for a dinner."));
}
